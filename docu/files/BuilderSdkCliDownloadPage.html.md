If you would like to create your own user interfaces to manage your services in the Builder, use the **Builder SDK CLI**. The Builder SDK is a command-line interface that runs the Builder in **developer** mode. This mode implements a Builder module faster and more efficiently.

Topics in this section include:

* Installation process for the application
* Extension, customization, and development of your own Builder module using the Builder
* Builder module descriptor and navigation inside the module
* Security of the Builder and utilities for authorization, notification, and linking
* The localized editor, which is a tool to add the names of your products in languages used by your target market

## Download the Builder SDK CLI

With the Builder SDK CLI, you can:

- Generate new Builder modules
- Run the Builder in developer mode rather than running the full application to maximize your available resources

You can download the latest Builder SDK CLI version for Windows or UNIX/Linux/MacOS.

</div>

### Install the Builder SDK CLI on Windows

 - Unzip the **builder4win.zip** file.
 - Run the `installerBuilder-SDK-CLI.bat` command with administrator permissions. This batch file creates the **C:\hybris\BuilderSDK** directory structure, and copies the **builder-cli-shade.jar** file into that directory. The installer also adds `BuilderSDK` to the **PATH** variable.

### Install the Builder SDK CLI on UNIX/Linux/MacOS

 - Unzip the **builder.zip** file.
 - Change the **builder** file into an executable file using the `chmod +x builder` command. Then, copy the file with admin rights to the **/usr/local/bin** directory so that the `builder` command is found in the **PATH** variable.
